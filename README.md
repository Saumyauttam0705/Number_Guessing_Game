Created a number guessing game using java.
It generates a random number within a specified range, 1 to 100 and prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.

Then compares the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.

 There are Three attempts for the user to guess the number and hence displays the user's score, based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
